# osm-gtfs-laval

A series of Python functions to visualize STL GTFS data and to convert to JOSM/OSM format for importing.It's a work in progress.

## Requirements
- Python requirements should be installed automatically by your IDE or use `pip install requirements.txt` to install manually
- You need to have GDAL installed on your system

## How to run
1. Download the desired (latest) gtfs archive and pass it as an input. The script is not meant to be ran by a cli at this point.
2. Look at the functions and run the ones you need.


## Notes
At this moment, the script is specifically written having STL data in mind and might not work with data from other operators. It needs to be adapted.
